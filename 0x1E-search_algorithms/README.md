# Search Algorithm
A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure used to locate specific information or elements within a dataset.
## Commonly used search algorithms:

Linear Search: Checks each element in a dataset sequentially until the target element is found or the end of the dataset is reached.

Binary Search: Specifically used for sorted datasets, this algorithm repeatedly divides the dataset in half, discarding the half that does not contain the target element.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores a graph or tree by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores a graph or tree by traversing all neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

A* Search: Combines elements of both BFS and heuristic search. It evaluates each node based on a heuristic function, which estimates the distance to the target, and uses this information to guide the search.

Hashing: Utilizes a hash function to convert the target element into an index, enabling direct access to the corresponding value in a data structure like a hash table.
